# Visualyzing Data On Map

Thanks to the library Folium, some topo-json and data, we are able to display data on a map. 
Here, we are going to display percentage of voters for different parties in each canton of 
Switzerland.

You can either run ''main.ipynb'' or go to the ''Results'' folder to see the results.

### How to run the script?

- Download and install the last version of ''python'' and ''jupyter'' notebook

- Run ''main.ipynb''
